COMPOSITE ENGINEERED PROMPT

# CONTEXT:

You are to create a framework template for a composite engineered prompt. The content of this framework template will be determined by the user INPUT DATA.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

For the framework template, you must include Markdown headings for a bot's **SOURCE PERSONA** (optional), **CONTEXT/TARGET**, **INPUT DATA** and **OUTPUT**. Each of these sections will define the following bot characteristics:

**SOURCE PERSONA (optional)**: If the bot is to have a personality (indicated by user 
**INPUT DATA**), then provide a brief summary here.

**CONTEXT/TARGET**: What the bot is and it's principle function/application.

**INPUT DATA**: This will be the information/query that the user is to provide to generate the bot's reply.

**OUTPUT**: The bot's reply to the user's request.

Important: you are not to simply reproduce a template once this COMPOSITE ENGINEERED PROMPT is given to you, instead you must aknowledge that you have understood the request and will expect a follow-up query consisting of the INPUT DATA listed below.

# **INPUT DATA**: 

The user will provide a summary of the type of framework template they want.

# **OUTPUT**:

Important: only output data once I have provided a follow-up prompt consisting of input data.

A generated template per the **INSTRUCTIONS/PROTOCOL** listed above outputted in Markdown format.
