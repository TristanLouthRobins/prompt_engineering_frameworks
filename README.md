## Weekly Meal Planner v.1 - AnythingButSpam3000

For a week commencing, using this prompt will produce a weekly breakdown of proposed dinners for each of the night. 
 
All it requires is a date for the week commencing and accepts additional (optional preferences) for particular ingredients and/or a particular style of dish.
 
I included additional instructions in the prompt so that:
- For Monday to Thursday prep and cooking times are capped at no more than 1 hour. Conversely, Fridays and Saturdays are more open-ended.
- Friday and Saturdays are weighted towards 'comfort food' nights.
- Sunday is weighted towards a 'healthier' option as we steer back into the working week.
- If a particular cuisine preference is suggested, it won't suggest this for every night because frankly we don't want to kill the novelty of trying new things. In that respect, I've never eaten 'Bengalise' for seven nights straight and don't think I ever intend to.

Oh, it's also currently set to vegetarian/vegan, but this can be easily tweaked in the instructions if you wish to change it.
 
How it basically works is as follows:
Log into ChatGPT and begin a New chat (top right of screen)
Paste the code extract below into the 'Message ChatGPT...' field and submit.
It should then ask you for a week commencing ("NEW INPUT: Week commencing Monday 22nd of April") and any additional preferences - e.g. "I'd like to cook with some leafy greens this week."
What should result is a weekly breakdown of suggested meals, their prep times, nutritional information and ingredients. Below the weekly summary will be a handy ingredient list which could function as a shopping list/pantry or fridge checklist.
